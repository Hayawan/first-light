# Morning Prompts Collection

## Intention Setting

1. What is the single most important thing you could accomplish today that would make everything else easier or unnecessary?

2. Write about one fear that's been quietly steering your decisions this week. What would you do differently without it?

3. Describe the version of yourself you want to be by tonight. What's one concrete action that version would take before noon?

4. What did you learn yesterday that you haven't fully processed yet? Spend five minutes writing through it.

5. Name three things you're grateful for right now — but go deeper than the obvious. Why each one? What would its absence feel like?

6. What conversation have you been avoiding? Write out what you'd say if you knew it would be received perfectly.

7. If today were a chapter in your autobiography, what would the chapter title be? Why?

8. Write a letter to yourself from six months in the future. What does that person want you to know about today?

9. What is one assumption you're making about your current situation that might be completely wrong?

10. Describe your ideal ordinary Tuesday — not a vacation, not a milestone, just a really good regular day. How far is today from that?

11. What commitment have you been honoring out of obligation rather than genuine alignment? What would it look like to renegotiate it?

12. Think about someone whose work or character you deeply admire. What quality of theirs are you neglecting in yourself right now?

13. What would you attempt today if you knew the first version didn't need to be good?

14. Where in your life are you optimizing for comfort when you should be optimizing for growth?

15. Write about a moment from this past week where you felt fully present. What conditions made that possible?

16. What's one boundary you need to set or reinforce today? Write out the exact words you'd use.

17. If you could only keep three commitments on your calendar this week, which three would they be? What does that reveal?

18. What emotion are you carrying into today from yesterday? Does it serve you, or does it need to be set down?

19. Describe one small habit that's been compounding in the wrong direction. What's the minimum viable course correction?

20. What's the most generous interpretation of the situation that's been frustrating you?

## Creative Writing

1. Write the opening paragraph of a story that begins with a sound nobody in the room can identify.

2. A character discovers that their morning coffee order has been subtly wrong for years — and someone has been changing it on purpose. Why?

3. Describe a city where the architecture changes based on the collective mood of its inhabitants. What does Monday morning look like?

4. Write a scene entirely through text messages between two people who are in the same room but can't speak aloud.

5. A librarian finds a book that contains the rest of their life, but the last three chapters are missing. What do they do?

6. Write about an object in your immediate surroundings as if you're seeing it for the first time and it terrifies you.

7. Two strangers share an elevator that gets stuck between floors. One of them knows something the other desperately needs to hear. Write their conversation.

8. Describe the world's most boring superpower. Now write a scene where it saves someone's life.

9. Write a recipe for something that isn't food — a recipe for forgiveness, for insomnia, for the feeling of arriving home.

10. A character wakes up to find that everyone remembers a version of yesterday that they don't. What happened?

11. Write the last entry of a journal found in an abandoned house. The writer is clearly saying goodbye, but not to a person.

12. Describe rain from the perspective of someone who has never experienced weather before.

13. A musician plays a note that doesn't exist on any known scale. Write about what the audience experiences.

14. Write a scene set in a restaurant where the food is a metaphor but the characters don't know it.

15. Two old friends meet after twenty years. Write only the subtext — what they mean versus what they actually say.

16. Describe a color that doesn't exist. What does it feel like? What memories does it evoke?

17. A package arrives addressed to you from yourself, postmarked three years in the future. Inside is a single object. What is it, and what does it mean?

18. Write about a door that shouldn't be there. It appeared sometime between last night and this morning. Where does it lead?

19. A character can hear plants. Most of the time it's boring. Today, the oak outside their window is screaming. Why?

20. Write a love letter from an inanimate object to the person who uses it daily.

## Productivity

1. List every open loop in your head right now — tasks, worries, half-formed ideas. Now circle the three that actually matter this week.

2. What's one task you've been doing manually that could be automated, templated, or eliminated entirely?

3. Describe your energy pattern yesterday hour by hour. When were you sharpest? When did you crash? How can today's schedule respect that pattern?

4. Pick your most important task for today. Now write out every single step required to complete it, no matter how small. What's the very first physical action?

5. What's on your to-do list that's been there for more than a week? Either do it in the next 30 minutes, schedule a specific time for it, or delete it.

6. Write about the last time you entered a flow state. What were the conditions? How can you recreate even two of them today?

7. If you could only work for four hours today, what would you spend them on? Now — why aren't those the first four hours of your actual day?

8. What's the highest-leverage skill you could improve by 10% this month? What's one action today that moves that forward?

9. Name the top three distractions that derailed you yesterday. For each one, write a specific if-then plan: "If X happens, I will Y instead."

10. Imagine explaining your current project to a sharp twelve-year-old. Write that explanation. Where does it break down? That's where your thinking is muddiest.

11. What meeting, commitment, or recurring task could you drop this week with minimal actual consequences? Be honest.

12. Write your done list from yesterday before your to-do list for today. What patterns do you notice?

13. What's the one thing you're procrastinating on that would create the most relief once finished? What's making it hard to start — is it unclear, boring, or scary?

14. Design your ideal 90-minute deep work block. What's the task? Where are you? What's off? What's the output?

15. Think about your current project. What decision are you avoiding because it would force you to commit to one direction? Write out both options and pick one in the next five minutes.

16. Where are you spending time on low-value "productive" busywork to avoid high-value uncomfortable work?

17. What's one process or workflow that frustrates you every time? Spend ten minutes redesigning it on paper before you start today's work.

18. Write your "not-to-do" list for today — things that feel urgent but aren't important.

19. If your future self could see how you spent today, what would they wish you'd done differently? Do that thing first.

20. What's one thing you could teach someone else today? Teaching it will solidify your own understanding and free up mental bandwidth.
