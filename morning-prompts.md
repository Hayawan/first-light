# Morning Writing Prompts

## Intention Setting

1. What is the single most important thing you could accomplish today that would make everything else easier or unnecessary?
2. Write about one fear that's been quietly steering your decisions this week. What would you do differently without it?
3. Describe the version of yourself you want to be by tonight. What's one concrete action that version would take before noon?
4. What did you learn yesterday that you haven't fully processed yet? Spend five minutes writing through it.
5. Name three things you're grateful for right now  — but go deeper than the obvious. Why each one? What would its absence feel like?
6. What conversation have you been avoiding? Write out what you'd say if you knew it would be received perfectly.
7. If today were a chapter in your autobiography, what would the chapter title be? Why?
8. Write a letter to yourself from six months in the future. What does that person want you to know about today?
9. What is one assumption you're making about your current situation that might be completely wrong?
10. Describe your ideal ordinary Tuesday — not a vacation, not a milestone, just a really good regular day. How far is today from that?
11. What commitment have you been honoring out of obligation rather than genuine alignment? What would it look like to renegotiate it?
12. Think about someone whose work or character you deeply admire. What quality of theirs are you neglecting in yourself right now?
13. What would you attempt today if you knew the first version didn't need to be good?
14. Where in your life are you optimizing for comfort when you should be optimizing for growth?
15. Write about a moment from this past week where you felt fully present. What conditions made that possible?
16. What's one boundary you need to set or reinforce today? Write out the exact words you'd use.
17. If you could only keep three commitments on your calendar this week, which three would they be? What does that reveal?
18. What emotion are you carrying into today from yesterday? Does it serve you, or does it need to be set down?
19. Describe one small habit that's been compounding in the wrong direction. What's the minimum viable course correction?
20. What's the most generous interpretation of the situation that's been frustrating you?
21. Marcus Aurelius began each morning preparing for difficult people.  Name one person you're likely to encounter today who will test your patience. How will you respond with grace instead of reactivity?
22. What story is your mind telling you about yourself right now? Write it down as a headline. Now write an equally true alternative headline. 
23. Strip something you've been craving lately down to its most basic components — what is it really?  A desire for status, for comfort, for connection? Does it still feel as urgent when described plainly?
24. Write down three values you most want to embody today — not goals, not tasks, but qualities of character. For each one, describe one specific action that would express it. 
25. What would you say to a close friend who was dealing with exactly what you're dealing with right now?  Now read that back to yourself. Why is it so much harder to take your own advice?
26. Describe yourself without using your job title, your relationships, or any role you play.  Who are you when you strip away every label?
27. What is one belief you hold about yourself that you've never questioned? Where did it come from? Is it actually yours, or did you inherit it?
28. Benjamin Franklin asked himself each morning: "What good shall I do this day?"  Answer that question — not in terms of productivity, but in terms of contribution to someone else's life.
29. What are three unspoken rules you absorbed from your family growing up? Which ones still serve you? Which ones are you ready to release?
30. If today were your last, which of your current worries would immediately evaporate? Let that answer tell you something about what actually matters.
31. Write out the thought that's been loudest in your head this week. Now prefix it with: "I notice I'm having the thought that…" Read it again. Does it feel different with that distance?
32. What internal experience — a feeling, a memory, a physical sensation — have you been actively avoiding? What would it look like to sit with it for just two minutes instead of pushing it away?
33. Think about someone who frustrates you regularly. What do you have in common with them?  What might they be struggling with that you can't see?
34. Where in your body are you holding tension right now? Put your hand there. What emotion lives in that spot? What does it need from you today?
35. What is one thing you're doing purely out of guilt that you could stop — and the only real consequence would be your own discomfort with saying no?
36. Imagine waking up tomorrow and your biggest current problem has vanished. Describe that day in detail. Now ask: which parts of that day could you create anyway, even with the problem still here?
37. Write a single sentence that captures the most important lesson you've learned in the last year. Now rewrite it shorter. Again, shorter. What remains when you strip it to its essence?
38. What are you currently optimizing for that your 80-year-old self would consider a waste of time? What would that person tell you to pay attention to instead?
39. Name one way you use self-criticism as a motivator. Is it actually working — or just familiar?  What would a kinder form of that same drive sound like?
40. What did you do yesterday purely because you wanted to, not because you should have? If the answer is nothing, that's worth ten minutes of writing.
41. Marcus Aurelius wrote: "Was I created to huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"  What is your version of hiding under the blankets right now — the comfortable avoidance masquerading as reasonableness?
42. Think about a recent decision you made on autopilot. If you had paused for thirty seconds before acting, would you have chosen differently? What does that reveal about your defaults?
43. What is one thing you consistently say yes to that slowly erodes your integrity? What would it cost you — really cost you — to stop?
44. Write down the strongest emotion you felt yesterday. Now trace it backward: what triggered it? What belief or expectation sat underneath that trigger?
45. If you could guarantee one change in your inner life — not your circumstances, but your internal experience — what would you change? What's one thing you could do today that moves toward that?
46. What part of your identity are you clinging to that may have already expired? Who might you become if you let that version of yourself go?
47. Think about the last time you compared yourself to someone. What specific quality triggered the comparison? Is that something you actually want, or something you think you should want?
48. Write the most honest answer you can to this question: What are you pretending not to know?
49. Seneca examined his day each evening, "hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by."  Do that for yesterday. What moment are you tempted to gloss over? Look at it directly.
50. If you treated your attention like a limited, non-renewable resource — because it is — what would you stop giving it to today?
51. What conversation are you rehearsing in your head that hasn't happened yet? Write out what you're afraid the other person will say. Is that fear based on evidence or on a story you've constructed?
52. What is one area of your life where you've been telling yourself "someday" for more than a year? What would need to be true for someday to become this week?
53. Think of a mistake you made recently. Write about it as if you were a compassionate biographer — someone who understands your context, your pressures, and your intentions, even as they name what went wrong.
54. What small, ordinary thing in your day reliably gives you a sense of meaning — not excitement, not achievement, but quiet purpose?  How can you protect that today?
55. What would change about your morning if you spent the first ten minutes in total stillness — no phone, no plan, no input? Describe what that silence might surface.
56. Name a time this week when you said something you didn't mean or stayed silent when you had something to say. What drove that gap between your inner truth and your outer behavior?
57. Imagine your life as a house. What room have you been spending all your time in? What room have you been avoiding? What might you find if you opened that door?
58. Write down one thing you need to forgive yourself for. Not to excuse it — but to stop letting it take up space in your present.
59. What relationship in your life would benefit most from your honesty right now? What's the honest thing you need to say or do — and what's stopping you?
60. If a trusted mentor could observe the last 48 hours of your life without you knowing, what pattern would they point out that you're too close to see?
61. What are you currently tolerating that you once swore you wouldn't? When did you stop noticing?
62. Write about someone who showed you unexpected kindness. What did it teach you about what people are capable of — and about what you're capable of extending to others?
63. What would today look like if you approached it with curiosity instead of control? Describe one specific situation where letting go of the outcome might actually serve you better.
64. Think about a goal you've been pursuing. Is it pulling you forward with excitement, or pushing you forward with anxiety? What does that distinction reveal about whether it's truly yours?
65. What's one question you've been afraid to sit with because you suspect you won't like the answer? Write it down. You don't have to answer it today — just let it exist on the page.
66. Describe the texture of your mental state right now using a metaphor — a weather pattern, a landscape, a body of water. What does that image reveal that a simple emotion-word wouldn't?
67. What small act of courage could you perform today that no one else would even notice? Something that only matters because you'd know you did it.
68. Who have you outgrown in the last year — not as a judgment, but as an honest observation? How is that reshaping the people you spend time with and the person you're becoming?
69. Write about a moment when you changed your mind about something important. What made the difference? What does that tell you about how you update your beliefs — and where you might be resistant to updating now?
70. What would your day look like if you truly believed you were enough — not as a platitude, but as an operating assumption? Name one specific thing you'd do differently starting this morning.

## Creative Writing

1. Write the opening paragraph of a story that begins with a sound nobody in the room can identify.
2. A character discovers that their morning coffee order has been subtly wrong for years — and someone has been changing it on purpose. Why?
3. Describe a city where the architecture changes based on the collective mood of its inhabitants. What does Monday morning look like?
4. Write a scene entirely through text messages between two people who are in the same room but can't speak aloud.
5. A librarian finds a book that contains the rest of their life, but the last three chapters are missing. What do they do?
6. Write about an object in your immediate surroundings as if you're seeing it for the first time and it terrifies you.
7. Two strangers share an elevator that gets stuck between floors. One of them knows something the other desperately needs to hear. Write their conversation.
8. Describe the world's most boring superpower. Now write a scene where it saves someone's life.
9. Write a recipe for something that isn't food — a recipe for forgiveness, for insomnia, for the feeling of arriving home.
10. A character wakes up to find that everyone remembers a version of yesterday that they don't. What happened?
11. Write the last entry of a journal found in an abandoned house. The writer is clearly saying goodbye, but not to a person.
12. Describe rain from the perspective of someone who has never experienced weather before.
13. A musician plays a note that doesn't exist on any known scale. Write about what the audience experiences.
14. Write a scene set in a restaurant where the food is a metaphor but the characters don't know it.
15. Two old friends meet after twenty years. Write only the subtext — what they mean versus what they actually say.
16. Describe a color that doesn't exist. What does it feel like? What memories does it evoke?
17. A package arrives addressed to you from yourself, postmarked three years in the future. Inside is a single object. What is it, and what does it mean?
18. Write about a door that shouldn't be there. It appeared sometime between last night and this morning. Where does it lead?
19. A character can hear plants. Most of the time it's boring. Today, the oak outside their window is screaming. Why?
20. Write a love letter from an inanimate object to the person who uses it daily.
21. Write a scene using only one-syllable words.  Let the constraint strip your language bare — blunt, rhythmic, and raw.
22. A woman discovers that every lie she's ever told has taken physical form as a small object in her attic. She goes up there for the first time in years. Describe what she finds.
23. Write the same three-paragraph scene twice: once as a comedy, once as a horror story. Change nothing about the events — only the telling.
24. A city has one law that no other city has. It seems absurd to visitors but makes perfect sense to residents. What is the law, and what happens when a newcomer breaks it?
25. Describe a thunderstorm from the perspective of a house that has stood for two hundred years. This is not the storm it's worried about.
26. Write a scene set in a waiting room where everyone is waiting for something different. No one says what they're waiting for, but the reader should be able to guess.
27. A character finds a handwritten note tucked inside a used book at a shop. The note wasn't meant for them, but it changes their entire week. What does it say?
28. Write a complete story in exactly 100 words. Not 99, not 101. Title it. Let the constraint sharpen every single sentence.
29. Two characters are cooking dinner together. One of them is about to deliver devastating news. Write the scene — but the news never gets delivered. Let the tension live entirely in what's unsaid.
30. Take an ordinary object within arm's reach. Describe it as if writing a museum placard for a civilization that vanished a thousand years ago. What does this artifact tell future archaeologists about how we lived?
31. Write a story in reverse chronological order.  Start with the ending. Work backward to the moment when everything was still okay.
32. A photographer develops a roll of forgotten film and finds three photos they have no memory of taking. Describe each photo and the story they suggest together.
33. Write from the perspective of someone attending their own surprise party — except they knew the whole time. What are they performing, and what are they actually feeling underneath?
34. Describe a character entirely through the contents of their grocery cart. No physical description, no backstory, no narration — just the items, and let them tell the whole story.
35. A barber has been cutting hair in the same chair for forty years. Today, a customer sits down and asks for a haircut that hasn't been in style since 1972. Write their conversation.
36. You find a voicemail on your phone from a number you don't recognize. The message is clearly meant for someone else. Write what it says — and what you do about it.
37. Write a scene set during a power outage in a building full of strangers. The darkness changes the rules of the space. What becomes possible that wasn't possible with the lights on?
38. A child explains something complex — death, divorce, economics, war — to another child on a playground. Write their dialogue with no adult corrections.
39. Describe a meal so precisely that the reader can taste it. Now reveal, in the final line, that the meal is a memory — and the person who cooked it is gone.
40. Write a story in which the narrator is unreliable, but the reader doesn't realize it until the final paragraph. Plant the clues early.
41. A town has a tradition: every resident writes one secret on a slip of paper and drops it into a public fountain on New Year's Day. This year, the fountain is being drained for repairs. Write about what they find at the bottom.
42. Take the last dream you remember and extract a single image from it. Use that image as the opening line of a piece of fiction. Let the story go wherever it wants.
43. Write a scene entirely in the form of a to-do list that gradually, between the mundane items, reveals something the list-maker is desperately trying not to think about.
44. A sculptor creates a statue that every viewer interprets as someone they've personally lost. The sculptor swears this wasn't intentional. Write about the day the statue is unveiled in the town square.
45. Describe the same room at four different times of day — dawn, noon, dusk, and 3 a.m. Change nothing about the room itself. Only the light changes. Let it reveal four different stories.
46. Write the opening of a novel that begins mid-sentence, as if the reader has walked into a conversation already underway. Hook them before they can orient themselves.
47. A letter carrier has delivered mail on the same street for fifteen years. They know things about these families that no one else does. Today, one envelope changes everything. What is it?
48. Write a conversation between two people who love each other deeply but speak completely different emotional languages. Neither is wrong. Neither fully understands the other. Show us both sides.
49. Choose a real historical figure and place them in a completely mundane modern situation  — grocery shopping, stuck in traffic, on hold with customer service. Write the scene with full fidelity to their actual personality and worldview.
50. A character wakes up one morning to find that gravity has shifted slightly — everything is just a little lighter. Objects drift. Steps hang a beat too long. Write the first hour of their day.
51. Write a story told entirely through the inventory of objects left behind in an apartment after someone moves out. No narration. Just the list, arranged so it tells a story.
52. Describe a sound you heard today to someone who has never possessed the sense of hearing. What does it feel like in the body instead?
53. Two strangers sit on opposite ends of a park bench. Write what each one is thinking in alternating paragraphs. They never speak, but their inner monologues echo each other in ways neither one realizes.
54. A character inherits a house where every room is painted a different vivid color. Each room triggers memories that don't belong to them. Pick one room and write what happens when they step inside.
55. Write a scene where the weather is a liar — the sun is blazing, the sky is perfect blue, and something is deeply, quietly wrong. Use the contrast between surface beauty and buried dread.
56. A restaurant menu contains one dish that has never been ordered in all the years the restaurant has been open. Write about the night someone finally orders it.
57. Write a piece structured as a classified ad for something that can't be sold — a grudge, a memory, a particular season of your life. Include condition, asking price, and reason for selling.
58. Describe a character's hands in enough detail that the reader can determine their occupation, approximate age, and whether they are gentle or rough — without stating any of it directly. 
59. A child gives a proud tour of their house to a visitor. What the child describes doesn't quite match what the visitor can see. Write the widening gap between the child's narration and reality.
60. Write a love story in exactly five sentences. Each sentence takes place in a different year.
61. A musician plays their final concert after a lifetime career. Write the scene from the perspective of their oldest instrument.
62. You wake up to discover that every mirror in your home now shows yesterday — you, doing yesterday's things, on a slight delay. Write the first ten minutes after you notice.
63. Write a scene set at a border crossing — any kind of border, physical or metaphorical. The thing the character is trying to bring across is not physical. What is it, and will they make it through?
64. A building is scheduled for demolition tomorrow. Write its final evening from the building's perspective. What does it remember? What will it miss?
65. Two people have been writing letters back and forth, but the letters keep crossing in the mail — every response arrives for the wrong letter. Write three rounds of this beautiful, escalating miscommunication.
66. A character walks into a room and knows immediately that someone has been crying, though no one says a word. How do they know? What do they do — and what do they choose not to do?
67. A character notices that their shadow has begun making slightly different gestures than they do — nothing dramatic, just a half-second delay here, a different angle there. Write the day they first notice.
68. Write a piece that takes place entirely in the two minutes between a doorbell ringing and the door being opened. Everything important happens in that pause.
69. Imagine a library that organizes books not by author or genre but by the emotion the reader needs. A character walks in feeling something they can't name. What section do they end up in, and what book finds them?
70. Write the inner monologue of a three-hundred-year-old tree in a town square on the morning it's scheduled to be cut down. What has it witnessed across those centuries? What does it want to say?

## Productivity

1. List every open loop in your head right now — tasks, worries, half-formed ideas. Now circle the three that actually matter this week.
2. What's one task you've been doing manually that could be automated, templated, or eliminated entirely?
3. Describe your energy pattern yesterday hour by hour. When were you sharpest? When did you crash? How can today's schedule respect that pattern?
4. Pick your most important task for today. Now write out every single step required to complete it, no matter how small. What's the very first physical action?
5. What's on your to-do list that's been there for more than a week? Either do it in the next 30 minutes, schedule a specific time for it, or delete it.
6. Write about the last time you entered a flow state. What were the conditions? How can you recreate even two of them today?
7. If you could only work for four hours today, what would you spend them on? Now — why aren't those the first four hours of your actual day?
8. What's the highest-leverage skill you could improve by 10% this month? What's one action today that moves that forward?
9. Name the top three distractions that derailed you yesterday. For each one, write a specific if-then plan: "If X happens, I will Y instead."
10. Imagine explaining your current project to a sharp twelve-year-old. Write that explanation. Where does it break down? That's where your thinking is muddiest.
11. What meeting, commitment, or recurring task could you drop this week with minimal actual consequences? Be honest.
12. Write your done list from yesterday before your to-do list for today. What patterns do you notice?
13. What's the one thing you're procrastinating on that would create the most relief once finished? What's making it hard to start — is it unclear, boring, or scary?
14. Design your ideal 90-minute deep work block. What's the task? Where are you? What's off? What's the output?
15. Think about your current project. What decision are you avoiding because it would force you to commit to one direction? Write out both options and pick one in the next five minutes.
16. Where are you spending time on low-value "productive" busywork to avoid high-value uncomfortable work?
17. What's one process or workflow that frustrates you every time? Spend ten minutes redesigning it on paper before you start today's work.
18. Write your "not-to-do" list for today — things that feel urgent but aren't important.
19. If your future self could see how you spent today, what would they wish you'd done differently? Do that thing first.
20. What's one thing you could teach someone else today? Teaching it will solidify your own understanding and free up mental bandwidth.
21. Write down every commitment you currently carry — professional, personal, social. Now apply this test to each: "If I didn't already have this, how hard would I work to acquire it?"  Anything that fails deserves renegotiation.
22. What is the most cognitively demanding task on your plate this week? Look at your calendar — is it scheduled during your sharpest hours, or crammed into whatever slot was left? Fix that today.
23. Imagine it's three months from now and your current project has failed completely. Write the post-mortem. What went wrong? Now come back to today — which of those failure points can you address this week?
24. Track your attention residue: what unfinished task or decision from yesterday is still occupying mental bandwidth right now? Either finish it in the next twenty minutes, capture the specific next action, or consciously release it.
25. Who is the type of person you want to become? Write that identity in one sentence.  Now scan today's to-do list — how many items cast a vote for that identity, and how many vote against it?
26. Pick one habit you're trying to build and run it through the four-law diagnostic. Is it obvious enough that you see the cue? Attractive enough that you actually want to do it? Easy enough to start in under two minutes? Satisfying enough that you feel rewarded? Fix whichever law is weakest.
27. What's on your "someday/maybe" list that has been there for more than six months? For each item, decide right now: move it to an active project with a concrete next step, or delete it entirely. No more someday.
28. How many hours of genuine deep work did you actually log yesterday? Write the honest number. Now write your target for today and the specific conditions you'll create to protect those hours.
29. What are you strategically neglecting right now — and is it the right thing to neglect? Name one area where you're deliberately underperforming so you can excel where it matters most. If you haven't explicitly chosen what to neglect, the world is choosing for you.
30. Write a one-paragraph description of how you want to be living and working three years from now — not a goal list, but a scene written in present tense as if you're already there.  Now identify one decision you could make today that aligns with that narrative.
31. What is the most important unsolved problem in your field or area of focus? Write it down plainly. Now answer honestly: why aren't you working on it?  What would need to change for you to start this week?
32. Look at how you spent last week and sort your activities into two columns: the 20% that produced 80% of your meaningful results, and everything else. What would next week look like if you doubled down on the first column and halved the second?
33. For every task on today's list, ask: "What would actually happen if I simply didn't do this?" Be ruthlessly honest about which tasks have real consequences and which you're doing out of habit, guilt, or the illusion of productivity.
34. Describe the kind of effort today actually requires — not every day calls for maximum intensity. Some days need patience, others need creative looseness, others need brute-force persistence. What mode fits today, and does your schedule reflect it?
35. What decision have you been postponing because gathering more information feels safer than choosing? Set a deadline: write the decision, your two best options, the strongest case for each, and commit to one by end of day.
36. Think of a recent piece of work you're genuinely proud of. Reverse-engineer it: what conditions made it possible? What obstacles did you clear? How can you deliberately recreate those conditions for today's most important task?
37. Review your calendar from last week. Highlight every time block that was reactive — responding to others' priorities — versus proactive — advancing your own. What's the ratio? What's one structural change that would shift it by 10% this week?
38. If you improved one specific skill by just 1% every day for the next year, which skill would produce the most cascading positive effects across your work and life? Name it. Now define today's 1% action.
39. What's one system, tool, or process you rely on daily that's actually adding friction rather than removing it? Spend ten minutes sketching the frictionless version. Is the fix a better tool, a simpler process, or eliminating the step entirely?
40. Write down three things you learned from your work last week. If you struggle to name three, that's a diagnostic signal — you may be executing on autopilot without reflecting. What would you need to change about how you work to learn more from it?
41. Name one task you keep doing yourself that you could teach someone else to handle. What would it take to create a simple one-page guide and hand it off? Calculate how many hours per quarter that handoff would reclaim.
42. Oliver Burkeman asks: "Is your drive to be more productive actually an excuse to avoid figuring out what you genuinely want to accomplish?" Sit with that for a full minute before writing. Then write your honest answer.
43. Map your "waiting for" list — everything you've delegated, requested, or are depending on someone else to deliver. Which items need a follow-up today? Which have been silently dropped? Make the invisible visible.
44. Think about your most recent work frustration. Diagnose the root: was it a lack of clarity (you didn't know what to do), a lack of energy (you knew but couldn't), or a lack of courage (you knew but didn't want to)? Each diagnosis has a completely different prescription.
45. Write your ideal morning routine — not a fantasy version, but a realistic sequence you could actually execute tomorrow. Identify the single biggest obstacle between your current morning and that one, and solve for that obstacle only.
46. What is one recurring meeting or commitment that consistently delivers less value than the time it consumes? Draft a concrete alternative — a shorter format, an async update, or a graceful exit. You don't have to send it yet, but write it.
47. Rate yesterday on a scale of 1 to 10 for meaningful work accomplished.  Now identify: what single factor most helped or hurt that score? That factor is your highest-leverage intervention for today.
48. Are you paying yourself first with your time? Examine today's schedule — are your highest priorities getting your best hours, or are you giving peak energy to other people's agendas and doing your real work with whatever's left over?
49. Pick one project where your plan is currently too vague to execute. Break it into phases, break the first phase into concrete steps, and identify the literal next physical action. Vagueness is the silent killer of progress.
50. Recall a recent day when you felt simultaneously busy and unproductive. List everything you did that day. Now categorize each item as essential, helpful, neutral, or a waste.  What pattern do you see — and what will you do differently today?
51. What are you saying yes to by default that you'd say no to if asked fresh today? Most productivity problems aren't about doing more — they're about stopping the wrong things. Identify one default yes to revoke.
52. Conduct a five-minute energy audit of yesterday: what activities gave you energy, and what drained it? Your most productive future isn't about doing more total hours — it's about doing more of what energizes you and ruthlessly reducing what depletes you.
53. Write your "pre-mortem" for this week: imagine it's Friday evening and the week was a disappointment. What went wrong? Now return to today — what specific actions today and tomorrow would prevent that  outcome?
54. Name one skill you've been meaning to develop but keep classifying as "not urgent." Write a paragraph describing what your work would look like if you were 25% better at that skill. Does that change its urgency?
55. Look at your to-do list and separate the tasks you genuinely find interesting from the ones you dread. For the dreaded ones: can any be eliminated, automated, delegated, or at minimum batched into a single contained time block so they stop contaminating your whole day?
56. Try time-blocking just the next three hours of your day — assign every minute to a specific activity. When reality forces a deviation, don't abandon the plan; redraw it.  The discipline lives in the replanning, not the original plan.
57. What is one piece of feedback you received recently that you dismissed too quickly? Revisit it with fresh eyes and honest self-assessment. Is there a kernel of truth worth acting on this week?
58. Examine your physical work environment — space, tools, noise, lighting, chair, screen position. Which single element, if improved, would have the biggest impact on your ability to focus? Make that change today, even if it's small.
59. Write a brief after-action review of your last completed project: What went well? What didn't? What will you do differently next time? File this where you'll actually see it before starting your next project.
60. If you could hire someone for ten hours this week to handle anything in your work or life, what would you assign them? That answer reveals what's draining you most. Even without the hire, the answer should reshape how you prioritize today.
61. What's one assumption about "how things have to be done" in your work that you've never truly questioned? What if you did it completely differently? Spend five minutes brainstorming the most radical alternative approach.
62. You will never "get on top of everything" — the inbox will never be empty, the list will never be done. Given that truth, what are you deliberately choosing to focus on this week? Frame this not as resignation but as a powerful, conscious act of selection.
63. Write down the three most important projects or goals in your life right now. For each, identify the single bottleneck — the one constraint most limiting progress. Direct today's energy at the bottleneck, not the easy surrounding work.
64. When you procrastinate, what do you actually do instead? List your specific displacement activities. Now study that list — what does it reveal about what your mind actually wants or needs? Sometimes procrastination is a signal worth decoding, not just a failure to override.
65. Describe the single best work session you've had in the past month. Be specific: what time, where, what task, how long, what was turned off, what was the tangible output? Now engineer tomorrow's schedule to reproduce as many of those conditions as possible.
66. What's one thing you keep saying you "don't have time for" that, if you're honest, is really about not having the courage or energy for? Time scarcity is often a proxy. Name the real blocker.
67. Draft a personal "rules of engagement" document for your workday: when you check email, when you accept meetings, when deep work happens, when you stop for the day. Writing these rules transforms vague intentions into enforceable policies.
68. Audit the information you consume daily — news, social media, newsletters, podcasts, Slack channels. What percentage actually changes your behavior or improves your work? Identify one source to cut this week and note what you'll do with the reclaimed time.
69. What's one way your current work routine is designed for a past version of yourself? Skills change, energy patterns shift, priorities evolve. Where has your system failed to keep up — and what's the simplest update?
70. Write a two-sentence memo to yourself at 3 PM today, when your willpower and focus will be at their lowest. What does future-you need to hear in that moment? Write it now and set a reminder.
